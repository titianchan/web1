<a class="body"> How often have you seen a great moment unfold in front of your eyes, only to realize that it's gone by the time you're ready to take a picture? You can improve your chances of taking the perfect shot if you know how to access the camera quickly.

If your iPhone is locked, simply press the round Home button to wake up your phone, then swipe left across the lock screen.

The camera will open instantly. You don't even need to enter your passcode to unlock your iPhone. With this trick you can literally start shooting in less than a second!

But what if you're already using the iPhone and you need to quickly access the camera? Just swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open the Control Center as shown below.</a>
